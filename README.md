Waveform-Analysis-for-ImageJ
============================

ImageJ plugins for analyzing and processing waveforms.  I use them for processing ultrasound waveforms, but they can be used with any type of time-varying signals.

Installation: Just add the jar file to the ImageJ plugins folder and restart ImageJ; the plugins will then be available in the Plugins menu.
